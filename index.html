<section id="why-use-wildtrax" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-use-wildtrax"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why use WildTrax?</h2>
<p>The WildTrax platform was developed by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) and the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html">University of Alberta</a>. The <a href="https://abmi.ca">ABMI</a> is an arm’s length, not-for-profit scientific organization that has been providing scientifically credible tools and information products on Alberta’s biodiversity and human footprint to provincial government, industry, environmental decision-makers, and Albertans since 2003. The ABMI has since become a global leader in the application and development of biodiversity monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental sensors</strong> (such as autonomous recording units [ARUs] or remote cameras) are an increasingly common monitoring method used to measure biological, environmental and ecological attributes across broad geographic scales. These sensors allow for automated collection of data over an extended period and can generate large amounts of valuable biological data.</p>
<p><strong>Biological data</strong>, such as counts of animals, their behaviour, or other attributes, can be derived from environmental sensors. WildTrax seamlessly integrates such data across multiple sensors, with the additional capacity to incorporate data from point counts, a commonly used method for evaluating species’ relative abundance, especially birds.</p>
<p><a href="https://wildtrax.ca/about/open-data/"><strong>Open data</strong></a> is data that can be accessed, re-used or redistributed by anyone and is freely available in a usable and convenient format. Open data benefits the scientific community and society. Data accessibility allows users (e.g., researchers, conservation practitioners and the public) to find, manipulate and analyze data, as well as link data to other types of information. Open data can lead directly to conservation knowledge and action. This requires data to be usable, compatible with other datasets, and reliable.</p>

<p>Your individual user account ensures data security and assigns specific roles within the system. Access to data is determined by several factors, including your role, location settings, and the publication status of projects. WildTrax uses a structured data hierarchy with permissions set the following levels to maintain controlled access. As roles are assigned in the system, data is kept data secure and accessible only to the right people. Each user has their own account with your access depending on your role, which determines the tools, features, and data sets you can see and use. <a href="#sec-organizations">Organization</a> and <a href="#sec-aru-projects">project</a> data availability considers factors like <a href="#sec-location-settings">location settings</a> and whether the data has been <a href="#sec-published-and-sharing">published</a>, ensuring it’s <a href="https://wildtrax.ca/about/open-data/">shared responsibly and securely</a>.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acoustic-data"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Acoustic data</h3>
<p>WildTrax supports a wide range of audio file types (WAC, WAV, W4V, MP3, FLAC) and recognizes naming conventions from most major autonomous recording unit models. Files should include a <a href="#sec-locations">location</a> and a date-time stamp and can be uploaded them directly to <a href="#sec-aru-projects">acoustic projects</a> for immediate task creation, or <a href="#sec-organizations">organizations</a> where you can generate tasks for projects based on other criteria, such as weather conditions or geographic regions, or take advantage of automated pre-processing with <a href="#sec-acoustic-classifiers">acoustic classifiers</a>.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remote-camera-data"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Remote camera data</h3>
<p>For <a href="#sec-camera-projects">camera projects</a>, select from one of three-level options to select from in order to upload your folder depending on where your <a href="#sec-locations">location</a> and deployments exist for each image set, in order to align with when camera are routinely checke in the field. Select the location-level folder to upload, and WildTrax will automatically pre-process images with <strong>MegaDetector V6</strong>. Quickly move onto species tagging by choosing from image- and tag-based filters in both Full and Series Tagging view.</p>

<p>When the project is completed and all data processed, the status of the project can be changed to a published status. Project publication allows other WildTrax users, who are not project members, to access the media, metadata or species detections from the project either through the project dashboard or <a href="#sec-data-discover">Data Discover</a>. The publication status will control how data will become visible across the system. Project publication will also lock users from editing species detections and is considered the final version of the data. You can change the status of a project at any time. <a href="#sec-locations">Location</a> and project membership settings will also determine what you and others can see. Ensure you have these correctly set before publishing a project. Here are some in-depth descriptions of each of the published statuses and what they mean.</p>

<li><strong>Active</strong>: Active projects are currently being processed or designed, or are in the preliminary stages of data uploading. Use this status for any general use or if the project is actively being worked on. This is the default project status when it is first created.</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>: Just getting started with an environmental sensor program? Or have some media you want to upload to test WildTrax’s functionalities? Use the Test status in these cases. Project data will not be visible in Data Downloads or Data Discover except to project members.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Published Projects</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Published – Private</strong>: Project data will only be available to project members. Users will need to request access to the project in order to view any details such as species or locations.</li>
<li><strong>Published – Map Only</strong>: Project data will be accessible through Data Discover but the media and report are not accessible to users who are not project members. If you’re not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.</li>
<li><strong>Published – Map + Report Only</strong>: Project data become available to all WildTrax users through Data Downloads and Data Discover, however, the media is not accessible. Use this setting if you want to make your data publicly available but there are privacy concerns with your media. If you’re not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply. This status does not exist for point counts since the sensor does not contain media.</li>
<li><strong>Published – Public</strong>: All of the project data become available to any WildTrax user as well as the public in <a href="#sec-data-discover">Data Discover</a>. If you’re not a project or organization member, <a href="#sec-location-privacy-settings">location buffering and visibility settings</a> will stil apply.</li>

<p>WildTrax operates under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">role-based access control</a> meaning users can collaborate to manage or share data to answer broader scientific questions by assigning appropriate privileges to the data. Access to certain features, tools, or data may vary based on your permission level. For example, access to project data can be restricted by <a href="#sec-location-settings">location settings</a> or the project’s <a href="#sec-publishing-and-sharing">publication status</a>. Here’s an overview of the key permissions levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sec-organization-membership">Organization membership</a> all you to see or govern access to all projects and data under an Organization. Permissions at the Organization level include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrator</strong></li>
<li><strong>Read-Only Member</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#sec-location-settings">Location visibility</a> and buffering controls whether whether locations are visible or hidden for privacy purposes</li>
<li><a href="#sec-aru-project-users">Project membership</a> dictates what you can do within specific projects such as uploading media, processing tasks or verify species tags roles include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrator</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tagger</strong></li>
<li><strong>Read-Only Member</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#sec-publishing-and-sharing">Project Status</a> dictates whether members or the public can access a project or its data. Active and Test projects are accessible only to members of the respective Organization or Project. Once a project is published, the visibility and access to its data depend on the permission level assigned to the user.</li>

<p>The interaction of these permission levels defines the scope of data you can view and how you can engage with it on WildTrax. For example, since Organizations are parent entities to projects, Organization administrators automatically inherit Project Administrator privileges. However, users assigned read-only access at the project level will not gain access to the parent Organization.</p>

<p><strong>Data Discover</strong> is the central hub for exploring environmental sensor data in WildTrax. Data Discover allows you to see which organizations have published data on WildTrax and which species were detected, and explore media elements such as images and sounds captured in the environment. In Data Discover, you can search for data from ARUs, cameras, and point counts, using a variety of attribute filters, and create summary statistics within a dynamic mapping interface where you can gain a comprehensive understanding of environmental sensor data in an area that interests you.</p>

<p><strong>Organizations</strong> sit at the top of the WildTrax hierarchy and are the central entity to which environmental sensor data, biological data and metadata are associated. When in doubt, if you’re looking for any information in WildTrax, you can likely find it under the organization. Organizations represent groups of users who collect data, design and publish projects, manage equipment and survey locations. Organizations allow you to coordinate efforts with multiple WildTrax users to create a structured, standardized dataset. Examples of organizations in WildTrax include government branches, industry, research labs, communities, non-profits and NGOs and citizen scientists.</p>

<p>WildTrax offers multiple choices for data storage designed to support the platform’s growing user base and evolving data management needs. Each Organization must select the storage location where they need to store their media. This allows you to quickly access an image or recording at a moment’s need. The current options as of September 05, 2025 currently include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WildTrax Live Servers</strong>: Hosted at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. These servers provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution with live and off-site backups using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/">Amazon Deep Glacier</a>, ensuring secure and reliable data storage for Canadian and international organizations.</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong></a>: Retained as an option for users requiring cloud-based storage with global accessibility and high-performance capabilities with international storage base options. Current locations include <strong>Oregon</strong> and <strong>Montreal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selection of a default storage location now balances data sovereignty, cost efficiency, and upload/download performance based on geographic proximity. For detailed guidance, refer to WildTrax’s <a href="https://wildtrax.ca/about/policies/">Terms and Conditions of Use and Data Access Policies</a>, or contact info@wildtrax.ca for additional support.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-default-privacy-settings"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Default privacy settings</h3>
<p>Organizations can manage the privacy of locations and images within the system to control what other users can access when data becomes published and more widely available. Location privacy can also be managed individually; see <a href="#sec-location-settings">Location privacy settings</a> for more information.</p>
<p><a href="assets/abmi-organization.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-15"><img src="assets/abmi-organization.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>For location privacy, two approaches are available within the <strong>Default Location Buffering</strong> field.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>True locations</strong>: Upload exact coordinates into the system. If a buffer is added, non-members or public viewers will only see buffered locations. This allows you to have access to and manage the true locations within WildTrax while simulatenously allowing users to gain access to the data without knowing the true coordinates</li>
<li><strong>Buffered locations</strong>: Supply pre-buffered coordinates to the system, specifying the radius used. This ensures the displayed locations are already obscured as intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Allow Location Reports</strong> feature enables you to create shareable links for external audiences, such as collaborators or landowners, without granting them privileges or exposing unnecessary details about your organization. The <strong>Default Location Photo Access</strong> field governs global permissions for accessing <a href="#sec-location-photos">location photos</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: Only members of the organization or project can view the location photos even if the project is published</li>
<li><strong>Project-level Access</strong>: members of the project can view the location photos, but non-members cannot even if the project is published</li>
<li><strong>Publicly Viewable</strong>: if a project is published, non-members can view the location photos within the tasks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Human Blurring</strong> applies organization-wide settings to blur humans detected in images. The available options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blur for anonymous users (if applicable)</strong>: images of humans will be blurred for all non-read only/non-admin WildTrax users if project data is visible based on the project status.</li>
<li><strong>Blur for non-admins</strong>: images of humans will be blurred for all WildTrax users regardless of their organization or project membership.</li>
<li><strong>Blur for everyone</strong>: images of humans will be blurred for all read-only WildTrax users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the option that best aligns with your needs and data privacy policies. For example, if you opt out of Human Blurring, you acknowledge that uploaded images—and those potentially shared publicly—may include humans, accepting the associated risks.</p>

<li>Add WildTrax users to the organization or its projects</li>
<li>Read and write to organizational locations</li>
<li>Read and write to the visit, equipment, deployment and media metadata</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organization read-only members</strong> can:</p>

<li>Read the unbuffered locations, i.e., read-only members can see the true locations if they are buffered but cannot modify them</li>
<li>Read the visit, equipment, and media metadata</li>
<li>Enjoy read-only access to all organizational projects</li>
<li>The organization dashboard lists all organizations in WildTrax. The View Only My Organizations toggle in the top-right filters the list to only organizations you’re a part of.</li>

<p>Did you know that locations are automatically created in the organization when you upload media either via <a href="#sec-upload-recordings">the organization</a> or <a href="#sec-upload-recordings-tasks">a project</a>? If a location name already exists in the organization, WildTrax will append the media to it, and if it is a new location WildTrax will prompt you during the upload process to optionally add spatial coordinates to these new locations. This allows processes, such as weather conditions, to be run in the background while your tasks are being created.</p>

<p>You can manage a location’s privacy settings individually by clicking the <img src="assets/pencil.png" height="30"> icon next to the location name. These settings control what information users can access about a location and its associated data, ensuring secure and customizable access across the system. WildTrax offers organization administrators multiple tools to define how members view locations and their data, providing robust privacy options to protect sensitive information as needed.</p>
<p><a href="assets/location-visibility.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-21"><img src="assets/location-visibility.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>The <strong>location visibility</strong> setting is used to hide locations and data from WildTrax users who are not part of the organization or project the location belongs to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>Hidden – Location</strong> if you want to hide only the location—only organization and project administrators will see the location in the maps across the system. Species data can still be downloaded by non-members but with no coordinates, non-members will not know where the data comes from.</li>
<li>Use <strong>Hidden – Location + Data</strong> if you want to hide both the location and the species information. This setting will effectively hide everything from users who are not organization or project members.</li>
<li>Use <strong>Visible</strong> if you want the location and data to be visible to everyone once the project is published</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Hidden – Location + Data, you can refer to location reporting to learn how to share data with users who are not members of the organization or project. This may include landowners, collaborators, or other users to whom you do not wish to grant privileges but are still able to share your data.</p>
<p><strong>Location buffering</strong> is another way to mask sensitive locations. You can use the location buffering toggle in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>True locations</strong>: Upload exact coordinates into the system. If a buffer is added, non-members or public viewers will only see buffered locations. This allows you to have access to and manage the true locations within WildTrax while simulatenously allowing users to gain access to the data without knowing the true coordinates</li>
<li><strong>Buffered locations</strong>: Supply pre-buffered coordinates to the system, specifying the radius used. This ensures the displayed locations are already obscured as intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The link to the <a href="#sec-location-reports"><strong>location reports</strong></a> is also available at the bottom of the form.</p>

<li>For a stable and secure upload process, it’s strongly recommended to use an ethernet connection before proceeding. Large uploads can take a while, so start with smaller batches to gauge your upload time, and then proceed with larger batches. -Supported format are the following. Each recording uploaded to WildTrax is either compressed as a <em>flac</em> or kept as an <em>mp3</em> if uploaded as such
<ul>
<li><em>wac</em> and <em>w4v</em> are proprietary, lossless compressed file formats developed by Wildlife Acoustics</li>
<li><em>wav</em> is the standard, ubiquitous uncompressed audio file format</li>
<li><em>mp3</em> a lossy compressed audio file format; works by reducing the accuracy of certain sound components, and eliminating others</li>
<li><em>flac</em> is a lossless compressed audio file format</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each recording must include a <a href="#sec-locations">location</a> prefix to be accepted. These are included in <a href="https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/">Wildlife Acoustics</a> ARUs but check your make and model type. The <strong>location name</strong> can be changed later if the prefix is incorrect and you do not have a way of changing the name on your local media.</li>
<li>Each recording must include a date and time in an accepted format (e.g., YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS). Once uploaded, the recording’s date and time cannot be modified, so ensure they are accurate before uploading. If errors are found after upload:
<ul>
<li>You must <a href="#sec-delete-recordings">delete the recording</a>.</li>
<li>Correct the name or metadata in your local copy.</li>
<li>Re-upload the corrected recording.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>To upload recordings for storage and processing in WildTrax, navigate to the Recordings tab and then click <img src="assets/upload.png" height="30"> This opens the recording upload window, where you can configure settings before uploading your files.</p>
<p>WildTrax provides several options to optimize your upload process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Including Subdirectories</strong>: Useful if your media is organized hierarchically.</li>
<li><strong>Removing Leading Zeros</strong>: Uncheck this option to retain leading zeros in location names</li>
<li><strong>Trigger Marking</strong>: Distinguishes triggered recordings from schedule-based ones. See <a href="#sec-setting-up-ultrasonic">Setting up an ultrasonic project</a></li>
<li><strong>Pre-Scanning</strong>: Scans for and displays sample rate and recording length during the upload process</li>
</ul>

<p>To begin, click <strong>Choose a Folder to Upload</strong>, select the directory containing your recordings, and let WildTrax scan the files. Once scanning is complete. Next, optionally enter spatial coordinates for new locations or update missing coordinates. This can also be done later using <a href="#sec-location-sync">location sync</a>.

<h3 data-number="4.7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-acoustic-classifiers"><span class="header-section-number">4.7.2</span> Acoustic classifiers</h3>
<p>An <strong>acoustic classifier</strong> is a computer algorithm designed to analyze audio recordings and identify the species producing the sounds. These classifiers interpret spectrograms, visual representations of sound frequencies over time, to determine the presence of specific bird species or other acoustic taxa. <a href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/">BirdNET</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954125001311">HawkEars</a> are two examples of such classifiers used by WildTrax, trained to process audio recordings and classify the species captured within them. For each recording uploaded to WildTrax, BirdNET and HawkEars are automatically run on the recording, and the results are made available in the <strong>Recordings</strong> tab, allowing users to view or further process the recordings in a project. Similarly, when recordings are <a href="#sec-uploading-recordings-and-tasks">uploaded directly through a project</a>, the <a href="#sec-acoustic-classifier-overlays">classifier overlays</a> are accessible in the processing interface. The algorithms behind these classifiers differ, which can result in varying levels of accuracy depending on the species and recording conditions, performing differently in specific situations.</p>
<p><a href="assets/recordings-with-species.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-36"><img src="assets/recordings-with-species.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BirdNET</strong> <img src="assets/birdnet.png" height="30"> is a worldwide bioacoustic classifier, which has been trained to classify thousands of species</li>
<li><strong>HawkEars</strong> <img src="assets/hawkears.png" height="30"> is a regional classifier that has been trained to classify hundreds of species, mostly Canadian and northern US species</li>
</ul>
<p>BirdNET and HawkEars analyze 3-second <em>windows</em> (i.e.&nbsp;periods of time) of the <a href="#sec-acoustic-data-concepts">spectrograms</a>, providing confidence scores from 0 to 1 for each species in their model. In other words, a score of 0.9 is more likely a hit of an American Robin than a score of 0.2.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-acoustic-data-concepts"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Acoustic data concepts</h2>
<p>Acoustic recordings are made by sampling sound pressure waves from the environment. Sampling rate (the number of samples taken per second) and bit depth (degree of quantization of pressure measurements) are two important values to consider when making sound recordings. Waveforms or the shape of the total acoustic signal over time are difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>These waveforms can be transformed into spectrograms. This is done using algorithms called Fourier transformations to make acoustic data more intelligible to a human or other software. These spectrograms contain patterns that a human can more easily use to recognize an acoustic signal and convert into biological data, such as animal vocalizations.</p>
<p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the acoustic energy in a recording created using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The x-axis corresponds to time, the y-axis to frequency and the z-axis (or how dark the signal is) to amplitude. Spectrograms in WildTrax are generated with a command line software called SoX. Audio file types have been calibrated to create the “best looking” spectrograms.</p>
<p>Animals use acoustic signals to communicate messages for mate attraction, territorial defense, identification, or alarm. Acoustic signals are important metrics that biologists and scientists can use to study animal populations, community assemblages, or individual fitness. Collecting sound signals also provides a permanent, unbiased, analyzable, and reproducible dataset for researchers in contrast to point count data.</p>
<p>An ARU can be deployed at a location for a long period of time. This provides a number of benefits to users processing acoustic data and project administrators to optimize their study design. If you’re just getting started using ARUs, WildTrax’s recommendations on how to best process acoustic data are based on the analyses, reports and publications that can be found in the Resources section.</p>
<p>How long you leave an ARU out at a location and how much data you process depends on your objective. Thus, there is no one answer that optimizes results for all species or for all questions. The inclusion of groups such as amphibians, owls, or nocturnal species changes the optimal ways of sampling with ARUs. For songbirds, there is strong evidence that shorter duration surveys (e.g., 1 minute) will increase detection rates and allow for a greater number of recordings from different days to be processed. This will result in more species found faster. However, trade-offs with other methodological approaches will occur. For example, 1 minute methods have higher detection error per visit but cumulatively have higher detection overall if you put in equal effort (10 x 1-minute point counts vs.&nbsp;1 x 10 minute point counts). More work is needed to understand the implications of using occupancy estimates from short versus longer periods of sampling time per individual point counts in terms of the stability of occupancy estimates. There are no firm recommendations on whether the total time should be 3, 5, or 10 minutes, etc. per recording processed. However, we do strongly recommend that listening in 1-minute time blocks within any longer interval provides the greatest flexibility in methods and highest return on processing investment. The ability to estimate parameters such as song rate with USPM methods increases the utility of such data and has the potential to help better measure a greater array of state variables (e.g., singing rate, occurrence or density). A single day of recording does not seem to be the best way to estimate occupancy or assess probability of occurrence. Leaving an ARU to record at a location for several days seems to provide a reasonable balance in getting detections from species that hold territories close to an ARU while also increasing the probability of getting rarer species with larger home ranges that only periodically are near an ARU. Less is gained by leaving them out for a month if it comes at the cost of visiting more locations.</p>

<p>The goal of an ARU project is to upload media, process tasks, verify tags and publish the results. Projects belong to organizations and use organization media on order to generate and report on a certain set of results designed by the project administrators.</p>
<p>Clicking on the ARU sensor on the main project dashboard will show which projects you have access to. The list of projects you see is determined by your organization membership, project membership and status of the project. You can use the filter and sort some of the project attributes to find what you’re looking for:</p>

<p>The Assign Species tab contains a set of tools that allow you to limit or choose which species you want to tag in your project. You may want to do this in order to control the amount of tagging error (incorrect species identification) or to limit which species you want to tag.</p>
<p>To add species to your project, click on a species in the Not Included column (the row will turn blue once selected) and click the arrows to add it to the project’s Included list. You can also unselect and select all from either column. Once a species has been tagged in the project, the assign species tab will automatically lock the row preventing you from removing the species from the project if it has already been tagged.</p>
<p>You can also add an entire group of species using the preset groups found in the Apply Preset button. Click Apply Preset and then search and select which groups of species you’d like to use. You can select one or many groups at a time. Once you’re done with your selection, click Submit and the species will be added to the project.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-upload-recordings-tasks"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Uploading recordings and creating tasks</h3>
<p>In order to process data, a task must be generated and assigned in WildTrax. A task is a unique combination of an acoustic recording, a processing method, and an observer. The observer needs to be at least a read-only project member and assigned the recording in order to process it. WildTrax has the ability to process acoustic recordings with multiple methods and users, however, please contact WildTrax Support to provide this service.</p>
<p>To upload recordings for processing, navigate to the Recordings tab and then click <img src="assets/upload.png" height="30"> This opens the recording upload window, where you can configure settings before uploading your files.</p>
<p>WildTrax provides several options to optimize your upload process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Including Subdirectories</strong>: Useful if your media is organized hierarchically.</li>
<li><strong>Removing Leading Zeros</strong>: Standardizes location naming to a generic WildTrax format (optional but recommended).</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Task Generation</strong>: Recordings uploaded through a project automatically generate tasks, enabling spectrogram creation and dashboard integration.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger Marking</strong>: Distinguishes triggered recordings from schedule-based ones.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Scanning</strong>: Displays sample rate and length during the upload process for better oversight.</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin, click <strong>Choose a Folder to Upload</strong>, select the directory containing your recordings, and let WildTrax scan the files. Once scanning is complete, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>In the next step, optionally enter spatial coordinates for new locations or update missing coordinates. This can also be done later using the Upload and Download Location tool. Key points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a location doesn’t exist in the organization, WildTrax will create it.</li>
<li>Recordings shorter than the specified method length by more than 3 seconds will trigger an error (e.g., a 56-second recording for a 60-second method).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve reviewed the form, click <strong>Upload Files in Queue</strong> to start the upload. For a stable and secure upload process, it’s strongly recommended to use an ethernet connection.</p>
<p>When recordings are uploaded to a project, new tasks are generated from the media and are added to the project dashboard under My Tasks.</p>
<p>A task is a unique combination of a user, a processing method and a recording. This flexibility allows you to generate tasks using the same recording but allow for multiple users or processing methods.</p>
<p>Go to the project dashboard and click My Tasks. The form will display the list of tasks currently in view depending on the View only my tasks toggle—switching the toggle to red allows you to filter the list to only your assigned tasks. The metadata for each one includes the location name, the date and time of the recording, the method it was assigned, the status of the task and the assigned user.</p>

<p>You can sync locations, tasks and tags via an ARU project. This allows you to make changes across many locations, tasks or tags as needed throughout the processing workflow. You may need to use sync to make large changes to location names or visibility settings, edit who is assigned tasks, or change metadata related to species tags. The logic of sync lies in downloading the data from a project (or a template with column headers if there is no data in the project yet).</p>

<p>Administrators can benefit from managing only the locations from the media in the project, This differs from location management at the organization level, where locations from all projects can be managed.</p>
<p>Click the Manage button and go to Download Location CSV to obtain the current list of locations in the project. If you don’t have any locations yet, a template will be provided. Make the changes or additions you’d like in the csv and re-upload the csv with the modifications using Upload Location CSV</p>
<p>If you didn’t generate tasks when you uploaded recordings to the project, or, if you’re using an organization’s recordings to create tasks, you can also use the Upload Tasks tool under the Manage button to automatically generate the tasks you need. Use the Download Tasks or Download CSV Template button and fill in the following fields:</p>
<p>Location: The name of the location. Recording date/time: The date and time that a ARU recording was collected (in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”). Task method: The method used to process the recording (SPM = 1 tag per individual per species per minute, SPT = 1 tag per individual per species per task, NONE = other methods). Task duration (seconds): The duration the recording was processed during the task or the duration of the point count. Observer ID: The unique numeric primary key of the observer that processed the image or recording, or that conducted the point count. ARU task status: The processing state of the ARU project task (recording) (i.e., “New,” “In progress,” “Transcribed,” ’Bad weather,” or “Malfunction”). Rain: The average rain on the task Wind: The average wind on the task Industry noise: The average chronic industrial noise on the task Other noise: Other noise averages on the task Audio quality: The audio quality of the task (recording). If you have hundreds or thousands of tasks without an assigned user, you can use the Randomly Assign button and select users from the dropdown list on the left to assign tasks to. It will randomly, and equally, assign unassigned tasks to the selected user(s).</p>
<p>If you’re a project administrator, you can also delete tasks from the project dashboard by clicking the drop-down arrow beside the desired task and clicking Delete Task. Follow the prompts and warnings accordingly as task deletion is permanent and irreversible.</p>
<p>The “Manage” button also contains functions that allow you to to upload and download tags to and from a project. This is useful if you’ve ever tagged acoustic data in another database and wish to sync it to WildTrax standard or you’re looking for a downloadable record of the tags and their metadata. Here are the CSV fields required in order to upload; if your project doesn’t contain any tags, you’ll be able to download a template first by clicking “Manage”.</p>
<p>Before you can upload tags into the system, you’ll need to first upload the recordings and create tasks in order to have the proper metadata needed to populate the tag CSVs. You cannot generate tags for tasks or recordings that don’t exist.</p>
<p>Location: The name of the location Recording date/time: The date and time that an ARU recording was collected (in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) Task method: The method used to process the recording (SPM = 1 tag per individual per species per minute, SPT = 1 tag per individual per species per task, NONE = other methods). Observer ID: The unique numeric primary key of the observer that processed the image or recording, or that conducted the point count. Species common name: The common name of the species that was observed in the tag or point count. Individual: This field corresponds to uniquely identified individuals of a species on the recording. In other words, if you hear two Ovenbirds (OVEN), the first individual would be tagged as “1” and the second OVEN as “2”. WildTrax has been designed to automatically populate the Individual field as new data is being entered. Therefore, if you forget to add in the individual number, the system will update it for you automatically in sequence. Vocalization: The vocalization type of the tag (i.e., “Song,” “Call,” or “Non-vocal signal”). Start time (seconds): The start time(s) of the window of the recording processed by the classifier. Tag duration (seconds): The duration of the tag (in seconds). Minimum frequency (Hz): The minimum frequency (in Hertz) of the tag. Maximum frequency (Hz): The maximum frequency (in Hertz) of the tag.</p>
<p>Click on the Manage button and select Upload Tags. In the new pop-up window, select Choose a CSV file to upload to select your tag data. When the file is uploaded, the “QA Tag Data” button will turn green. Click it and WildTrax will ensure that the data you’re uploading fits the WildTrax standard. This may take a few minutes depending how large your file is.</p>

<p>You can dynamically set the audio settings which control the spectrogram and audio parameters of the recording for the task. These settings are set by default at the project level by an administrator but you can change them at any time while processing a task. You can set the audio settings by either clicking on the gear icon below the spectrogram or going to Manage &gt; Audio Settings above and to the right of the spectrogram. When you have your desired settings, click Apply or Reset to the project defaults.</p>
<p>Channel: Set the default channel that will display on the screen (left, right or both) Amplify: Increase the gain or amplitude of the audio to hear faint sounds Minimum and Maximum Frequency (Hz): The minimum and maximum bounds displayed on the spectrogram. The audio will be played for the entire spectrum unless the Generate Audio toggle is enabled. X-Scale: Use the slider to change the amount of seconds displayed on the spectrogram. A lower value will display more time whereas a larger value will display less time. Y-Height: The spectrogram height in pixels. A larger number will increase the vertical dimension of the spectrogram Use Monochrome: When toggled on, displays spectrogram in a monochrome format (black and white). Toggle off to display colour spectrogram.s Generate Audio: When toggled on, only the audio between the selected frequency ranges will be played. Noise Filter: Attempts to apply a noise filter to better help hear the signal. Contrast: Contrast range in dB. Default is 120 dB. This sets the dynamic-range of the spectrogram to be the selected value dBFS to 0 dBFS. This may range from 20 to 180 dBFS. Decreasing dynamic-range effectively increases the ‘contrast’ of the spectrogram display, and vice versa. Brightness: Sets the upper limit of the Z-axis in dBFS. A negative number effectively increases the ‘brightness’ of the spectrogram display, and vice versa.</p>

<p>ARUs don’t discriminate between noise sources, including geophonic (e.g., wind and rain) and anthropogenic (e.g., human produced) sounds. Assessing, tagging, and recording these noise sources is important as they can affect species detection depending on the frequency range and amplitude of the abiotic signal.</p>
<p>For example, certain recorders can be placed very close to industrial features such as compressor stations where noise is almost constant throughout the entire recording due to motors, fans, engines, etc. Others can be located near busy roads where cars may pass by. All these sounds have distinct acoustic signatures that can be identified and tagged on a spectrogram. Noise sources can also be biotic such as bugs flying past the microphones.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the assessment of noise can be made both through frequency and/or amplitude. Even faint broad-scale sounds will affect species detection, whereas a loud low-frequency sound can also trick the ear into missing biotic signals.</p>
<p>All ARUs produce a certain amount of internal static; you can record the static to indicate a possible equipment failure. Older models of ARUs have a lower signal-to-noise ratio that can produce the increase in static.</p>
<p>As wind, rain, and industrial noise increase in intensity and frequency, biotic sounds are harder to detect and accuracy with species identification decreases. You can avoid processing certain tasks where wind, rain, background, or industrial noise is above a certain threshold defined by the project.</p>
<p>You can quickly check if the task will be appropriate for conducting an analysis based on the noted noise threshold. Sometimes this can be very easy (e.g.. recording will have obvious heavy rain). Other times you may need to scroll quickly through the recording to check. You can either proceed with the transcription or change the status of the task to Bad Weather and move onto the next task.</p>
<p>The weather panel also provides a way of making assessments of the weather conditions to determine whether or not they are appropriate for processing. WildTrax will develop recommendations for this in the near future.</p>
<p>Conditions recorded at the nearest weather station (at the nearest time to when the ARU recording took place) are located in the panel just above the spectrogram. Clicking on the panel opens the detailed weather information panel describing both hourly and daily conditions recorded at weather stations within a maximum radius of 155 km. You can toggle through the list of stations with the Previous and Next buttons to get the conditions recorded at various stations.</p>

<p>The acoustic processing methods in WildTrax are designed to emulate avian point counts and are an amalgamation of recommendations provided by the Bioacoustic Unit, the Boreal Avian Modelling project, and Environment and Climate Change Canada based on standard methodologies.</p>
<p>The processing method is chosen either during the upload stage of the media or by uploading tasks to a project and is based on two values: the processing length of the recording and the “count-removal” method type.</p>
<p>The first component is the length of time in seconds. The easiest way to think of count-removal is when you tag an individual of a species and then want to “remove it” from the rest of tagging. WildTrax will automatically implement this limit depending on the method you choose. Here we define the limit at the individual level, like OVEN 1 and OVEN 2. There are currently options for a tag per minute limit (1SPM), a tag per task limit (1SPT) or an unlimited number of tags (None).</p>
<p>Contact WildTrax Support if you would like an additional method added.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tags"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Tags</h3>
<p>You can add tags (click and drag a box) or markers (Hotkey: 1) on spectrograms.</p>
<p>The boxes that comprise the tag are the fundamental way that WildTrax differs from many other audio tagging systems: they allow you to enclose a species detection in real-time while providing information about vocalization frequency, length and amplitude using the dimensions of the box. When a box is drawn on the spectrogram, WildTrax requires you to enter species metadata after it is created, which pauses the recording while the metadata is being added.</p>
<p>In contrast, you can use markers to indicate where a signal is detected without stopping the playback. You’ll still need to return later to each marker, draw a box, and enter the appropriate species metadata but this way you can rapidly annotate the vocalizations you want. WildTrax offers these two different ways to tag species to allow you to create your own workflow for data processing.</p>
<p>When a signal is detected, click and drag on the spectrogram to create a box. Draw the box around the outside of the signal. Depending on your study design, you may want to include harmonic frequencies. Once you’ve drawn the box, the Add New Tag window will pop up on the right side of the spectrogram.</p>
<p>There are a minimum set of rules that WildTrax uses to create tags. As the system develops, new rules may be applied in the future. Project administrators are invited to instruct their members to annotate species as necessary for the objectives of the project.</p>
<p>Tags are a minimum of 0.1 seconds and a maximum of 20 seconds long as defined by the constraints of the maximum dimensions of the spectrogram currently employed in WildTrax Tags will always have a minimum frequency of 0 Hz and a maximum frequency of 12,000 Hz as defined by the constraints of the maximum dimensions of the spectrogram Regardless of spectral coverage, a tag must always have minimum dimensions of 0.1 seconds and 200 Hz otherwise the tag will automatically disappear (in reality the tag must have a minimum size of 5 x 5 pixels) Depending on what method is applied to the task, the number of tags per species-individual you can make may be restricted</p>
<p>The tag should enclose the whole signal The tag should be as “tight” as possible around the signal leaving as little space as possible The tag should capture important vocalization patterns and repetitions</p>
<p>The fields associated with each tag are as follows:</p>
<p>Species: This field is a dropdown that operates through detecting text either by a modified version of the American Ornithology code system or the English common name of the species. Individual: This field corresponds to uniquely identified individuals of a species on the recording. In other words, if you hear two Ovenbirds (OVEN), the first individual would be tagged as “1” and the second OVEN as “2”. WildTrax has been designed to automatically populate the Individual field as new data is being entered. Therefore, if you forget to add in the individual number, the system will update it for you automatically in sequence. Needs Review: This checkbox flags tags for expedited verification or if you’re not confident in the identification of the species or the tag metadata. Abundance: This field stores abundance information for each detection. It is broken down into two main categories: for amphibian calling intensity(CI) and all other species (1-10 and TMTT). Vocalization Type: This field describes the type of vocalization each detected species/individual made. Vocalization type can be changed for each individual in each minute interval as well. The current options are song, call and non-vocal. Comments: Use this field liberally to make notes about any of the songs or calls relating to the species in question, especially in the case of unknowns. At any time during tagging you can edit the information stored for each tag either by clicking on the box, or visiting the logged sounds table. Once you click on the box, you can change the dimensions, position or the metadata for any of the fields when the tag panel is open. You can even change the species code of the tag in case it was, for example, accidentally misidentified or you wanted to change it to an unknown. You can also delete the tag altogether.</p>
<p>Every time a tag is made, the information is saved below the spectrogram in the logged sounds table. This is a running list of all of the detections that are currently in the task. The table lets you keep track of the species and individuals that are already tagged and provides another place to edit tags.</p>
<p>Components of the table include the species code, the minute intervals where the species was detected (where applicable depending on method), the abundance, the vocalization type of the species (shaded in different colours to allow ease of visualization) and the confidence of the identification. If you hover over a coloured cell, you can also see the second within the minute interval that the box was created, and by clicking on the cell, WildTrax will transport you directly to the part of the spectrogram where the species was detected and play the recording (if Auto play mode is selected).</p>
<p>This will also open the Tag panel. Clicking on the drop-down arrow beside the Confidence field will also let you navigate back to the species detection and make edits in the Tag panel. The switch just below the spectrogram allows you to toggle auto-playing the recording when you navigate to a tag.</p>

<p>Each tag in WildTrax records the individual number and abundance. These fields seem similar but are quite different, and how you use them to tag your data is dependent on your research objectives. Check with your project administrator on how to tag species on your assigned tasks.</p>
<p>An individual is the unique identifier for distinct individuals of a species. Here’s an example of a Tennessee Warbler (TEWA) that receives an individual number of 1 (since it is the first) and an abundance of 1 (since it is one individual).</p>
<p>If required by your project, it’s important to ensure individuals are tracked consistently through each interval of the processing method. This way all individuals are annotated correctly.</p>
<p>The number of individuals you can distinguish and track is dependent on multiple factors and these can either facilitate or hinder your ability. Accuracy in individual tagging increases when:</p>
<p>individuals are territorial (separated spatially) individuals are sedentary (not moving or not appearing to move via spectrogram attributes such as amplitude or channel) individuals have unique song attributes or singing behaviour the species richness on the recording is low (there are no masking signals) abiotic signals on the recording are low (there is no noise interference)</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to tag distinct individuals when certain species have life history traits or behaviour leading them to be abundant. Alternatively, you can tag multiple individuals of a species at once and change the abundance value to reflect the count of individuals of that species in the tag. You can also use the TMTT (too many to tag) option to indicate an uncountable number of individuals of the species within the bounds of the tag.</p>
<p>Increasing the abundance value should only be used when you’re certain you can’t tell individuals apart. If you’re unsure, it’s recommended to always use the more conservative estimate. Practicing also helps!</p>

<p>During the breeding season, amphibians congregate together making individual counts difficult. Therefore, WildTrax uses a calling intensity (CI) rank as a common measure of estimating amphibian abundance rather than by distinguishing individuals, like with birds or mammals. Call intensity is used as a metric for relative abundance and is adapted from the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP) Amphibian Calling Index (ACI) (2005).</p>
<p>CI 1: Individuals can be counted, there is space between the calls CI 2: Calls of individuals can be distinguished but there is overlap CI 3: Full chorus, calls are constant, continuous and overlapping</p>

<p>There are degrees of uncertainty in identifying acoustic signals on a recording. Since vocalizing species make a variety of different sounds, the ability of an observer to identify many hundreds of species and all their vocalization types is learned over time. Checking the Needs Review box helps to filter tags for verification.</p>
<p>When you come across a signal you don’t recognize, you can either classify it as Needs Review and/or as unknown. It’s important that these unknowns are incorporated into the dataset accordingly to define that:</p>
<p>The signal is clear but it cannot be identified The signal is too degraded, faint or masked The signal is a non-descript short call note or alarm call As unknowns are detected they should be placed into sub-categories as much as possible to refine how another observer or project administrator will identify it later on. For example, a triller should be identified as UNTL instead of UNPA (unknown passerine) or UNKN (unknown). Be conservative in the categorization process—if you’re not sure, always revert to the more basal category, like UNKN. Some signals are too faint, degraded or masked, that they’re likely not identifiable. The threshold of signal identification is dependent on many factors including amplitude, signal complexity, observer skill, and how much the signal is masked or overlapped by others in the recording. There are certain species complexes that cross over families and genera of species—in this case the more conservative unknown code should be used.</p>
<p>Faint, generic, and indistinct call notes tend to be overlooked when conducting community census tagging as they do not provide much information to the occupancy or detectability of that individual over time; the BU uses standardized replication at each station to account for these tendencies.</p>
<p>Once a tag is labeled as Needs Review, the panel in species verification will also change to yellow. See species verification for more details.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.3.9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vocalization-types"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.9</span> Vocalization types</h3>
<p>Animals can produce many different vocalizations. In the current version of WildTrax, vocalizations are categorized as either song, call or non-vocal and for ultrasonic species call+feeding buzz.</p>
<p>Song is loosely defined as the male, territorial, mate-attracting vocalization produced by passerine (songbird) males and some non-passerine species. In many bird studies, passerine song is used to estimate the density and population size of a species and is a reliable metric. This is because a male passerine generally sings in the territory it’s occupying.</p>
<p>Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) song Black-throated Green Warbler (Setophaga virens) multiple song types Calls are any vocalization made by individuals where the sex cannot be distinguished and/or the vocalization is not for mate attraction. Some examples of this include the simpler and less melodious vocalizations typical of some non-passerines as well as vocalizations like alarm calls, begging calls, etc.</p>
<p>Exceptions can and do exist in the natural world. For example, despite being passerines, all corvid vocalizations are calls, as both males and females can produce them. Conversely, the Yellow Rail (YERA) is a non-passerine but the primary vocalization (“tik-tik tik-tik-tik”) is always entered as a song since it is for territorial delineation and mate attraction, and the female does not produce the vocalization.</p>
<p>Flight calls are other unique vocalizations given by birds that WildTrax differentiates as they come from trigger-based recordings and separate study designs from scheduled-based recordings. It’s possible with certain families like the thrushes (Turdidae) and blackbirds (Icteridae) to identify these call signals to species.</p>
<p>Night flight call notes White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) call notes Swainson’s Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) call notes</p>
<p>Non-vocal vocalizations are mechanical sounds made by a species, such as winnows, bleats, drums or booms that are not made by the vocal tract.</p>
<p>Wilson’s Snipe (Gallinago delicata) winnowing Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) drumming Call+Feeding Buzz are the rapid series of calls produced to capture prey by echolocating species.</p>
<p>Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) feeding buzz</p>
<p>Depending on the taxa that you’re studying, you may want to use these categories differently than how WildTrax suggests. These recommendations, while imperfect, reflect common practices and help to standardize vocalization metadata. Nevertheless, the system is agnostic to vocalization type standards and is a proponent in making the system as flexible as possible. If you have a recommendation or suggestion on how to help develop this standard, email WildTrax Info.</p>

<p>The species verification tab houses a set of tools to assist in the quality control of acoustic tags. In species verification, administrators assign users as validators to verify all tags grouped from a species-vocalization type in a project. Species-vocalization type is used for the grouping to allow the user to focus on one signal type at a time, e.g., Wilson’s Snipe (WISN) calling vs.&nbsp;winnowing. Species verification is important because it allows you to efficiently check all the tags produced in a project before publishing it, thereby dramatically increasing data quality output.</p>
<p>ARU species verification in WildTrax is a two-stage approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create or import tags in a project</p></li>
<li><p>Verify all the tags of a species-vocalization type</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This allows a WildTrax user to have the first pass at processing the acoustic data and then use the verification tools to target and verify tags. Verification tags are populated once the task is completed (or switched to Transcribed). Clicking on the Species tab in the project page displays a list of species-vocalization types, summaries of the total number of verified tags, and tools to assign users for verification, in order to help you manage the verification process. Click on any of the species to enter the verification page.</p>
<p>This is the standard practice currently used in WildTrax. Use this route if you have trained taggers who will be generating tags from assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Upload recordings to a project and generate tasks by checking Create a new task Assign users as taggers to the tasks Tag all of the tasks in a project Assign validators under the Species tab Verify all of the tags for each species-vocalization type where desired; return to the tasks to change or delete tags where needed Filter by verified tags and mark high quality ones as Nice, or mark as Nice as you verify Proceed to publishing your verified project</p>
<p>If you have outputs from a recognizer and wish to verify the hits and share the results in WildTrax:</p>
<p>Upload recordings to a project and create tasks Upload tags from the automated classifier Assign validators under the Species tab Verify all of the tags for each species-vocalization type where desired; return to the tasks to change or delete tags where needed Rate the tags to help determine recognizer performance Proceed to publishing your verified project</p>
<p>The verification page header designates the species-vocalization type you’re verifying and the filters are metadata you can use to filter the list of tags you see in the single tag panels. The single tag panels allow you to individually access and manipulate the audio and spectrogram properties, and take actions in order to verify the tag.</p>
<p>You can listen to any of the audio in the single tag panels by clicking the Play button in the top-left hand corner. The icons below the spectrogram indicate the following:</p>
<p>Verify: when checked green , the tag has been verified. The background of the single tag panel will also change to green. Rating : when checked yellow , the tag has been rated Task link : opens a new tab to the task where the tag was created; the tag will be coloured black in the task BirdNET probability: maximum probability (0-1) returned from BirdNET. The number is the maximum value found in all of the 3-second windows where BirdNET also positively detected the species and intersected the tag. Amplitude : peak amplitude (in dBFS) of the tag Abundance: abundance of the species made in the tag. If TMTT, the icon will appear as</p>
<p>WildTrax uses the BirdNET API and returns the maximum probability from all the 3-second windows that intersected the tag. Note, results from other species are not returned.</p>
<p>WildTrax returns the maximum value in all of the 3-second windows (in dashed blue lines here) generated by BirdNET that intersect the tag. The value indicates the probability of BirdNET having detected the species in that interval. If BirdNET doesn’t detect the same species, the probability will be 0. You can also click on the button which opens the Help menu describing everything from the legend to keyboard shortcuts and tag selection methods so you can customize your verification workflow the way you want.</p>
<p>Clicking on the top-right corner of the single tag panel opens the detailed verification window. This window allows you to manipulate the audio and spectrogram parameters in order to verify the tag. The main sections of the detailed verification window include:</p>
<p>Task link (in the header) Action buttons Tag details Spectrogram Filters The task link will open a new tab and jump back to the task to view where the tag took place, highlighting the tag in black. This is useful if you need more context beyond what is available in the detailed verification window.</p>

The changes will also be tracked in the audit table of the task. Tag details in the left column summarize other useful information about the media and tag in order to help make a decision on the verification of the tag.</p>
<p>Minimum frequency: minimum frequency of the tag Maximum frequency: maximum frequency of the tag Length: length of the recording (seconds) Default channel: indicates the channel used for default verification. If one of the channels were malfunctioning, the better channel will appear by default. BirdNET probability: maximum value returned from BirdNET Peak dBFS: maximum amplitude of the tag</p>
<p>You can manipulate the audio and spectrogram using the different filters and editors located below the tag. These include the following settings that you can combine in any way you’d like to generate the best-looking and -sounding spectrogram to verify the tag.</p>
<p>Amplify: increases the gain, or amplitude, of the media. Noise filter: runs a noise profile on the tag and attempts to eliminate noise. Channel filter: Select the channel you want to display and listen to (Left or Right). By default, the left channel is visible while both channels are audible. Z Contrast: Contrast range in dB. Default is 120 dB. This sets the dynamic-range of the spectrogram to be the selected value dBFS to 0 dBFS. This may range from 20 to 180 dBFS. Decreasing dynamic-range effectively increases the ‘contrast’ of the spectrogram display, and vice versa. Z Brightness: Sets the upper limit of the Z-axis in dBFS. A negative number effectively increases the ‘brightness’ of the spectrogram display, and vice versa. Y Scale: Expand the number of pixels displayed on the Y axis. Default is 1x. A larger number stretches the spectrogram vertically. Frequency filter toggle: when turned on, limits the audio file to playing only the frequency bounds of the tag. Helpful for eliminating other bandwidths to more clearly hear the signal.</p>

<p>A <strong>remote camera</strong> can be deployed at a location for a short or long period of time. One or several units can be deployed at a single location for years, swapping out the batteries and SD cards every so often depending on usage, or the unit(s) can be moved to a new location. This flexibility provides great benefit to a user or researcher, as the only limitation to data collection is storage space and battery life. Depending on the length of time these units will be in the field prior to being serviced, camera settings can be changed to optimize battery life. When developing a remote camera sampling design for questions related to density estimation, relative abundance, occupancy modeling, etc., strong considerations should be made regarding the length of time in the field, number of units to install and the distance between units. Resources on camera deployment methods, sampling protocols and analytical approaches can be found in the <a href="https://wildtrax.ca/resources/">Resources</a> section.</p>

<p>Projects are purposeful groupings of an organization‘s media and metadata to answer specific questions or implement a study design. Projects can be one of three sensors: ARUs, cameras or point counts. For each of these sensor types, a collection of tasks (ARU), image sets (camera) or surveys (point counts) are processed or uploaded in order retrieve species data.</p>
<p>WildTrax requires at least one administrator per project. Project administrators manage the upload of media, user management and assignments, auditing and species verification, and project publication. Organization administrators create the project and assign a project administrator to manage it. These administrators also add read-only members or share location reports with other WildTrax users.</p>
<p>The general life cycle of a project involves:</p>
<p>Creating a project Adding users to the project Uploading media or data depending on the sensor Creating or uploading tasks or surveys Creating (processing) or uploading tags or observations Verifying and quality controlling tags</p>

<p>The use of remote cameras can lead to the capture of hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of images in a single image set. The large data sets collected are a benefit to users; however, image processing is also usually a bottleneck to producing meaningful data in a timely manner. The time required for humans to process each image and categorize animals or humans can be incredibly time-consuming and inefficient. WildTrax’s auto-tagger features allow you to reduce the time required to review remote camera images by applying tags to images, or <strong>auto-tagging</strong> before you begin manually tagging. WildTrax’s current auto-tagging classification includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>MegaDectector Version 6 (MDV6-yolov10-e) from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps">Pytorch Wildlife</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>STAFF/SETUP tagger</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The STAFF/SETUP tagger is a setting used to select the application of the STAFF/SETUP tag automatically to image sets. The auto-tagger will automatically tag images of humans that occur within the first or last series as “STAFF/SETUP” (using a 5-minute series gap), unless there are &lt;2 images auto-tagged as human, or the STAFF/SETUP tag has already been applied.</p>
<p>Once you’ve applied auto-tagger setting in <a href="#sec-camera-project-settings">Camera project settings</a>, any image data uploaded into the project will be run through the auto-tagger based on your selection of classifier categories before they become available for tagging.</p>

<p>Tagging images in WildTrax is relatively flexible in that the user can be as general or as detailed as your question requires. Tagging entails the application of one or more tags, composed of a species, sex, age and number of individuals, to each image. In the future, WildTrax will allow for the application of additional tags such as coat colour, snow depth, etc.</p>
<p>From the tagging screen, select one or more images for tagging in multiple ways:</p>
<p>Click on the image to select it. Click and drag your cursor over groups of images Using Shift, you can click on the first image; then, holding Shift, click on the last image to select all images in between. Using Ctrl, you can select multiple images that are not in consecutive order. This includes being able to drag boxes around multiple subsets of images. Select images in the panel on the left-hand side of the screen. Note: Selected images will be highlighted in teal in the number panel. Press ESC at any time to deselect highlighted images. Apply tag(s) to selected image(s) using the tagging window. With image(s) selected, click on “Tag Selected X,” where X represents the number of images you have highlighted for tagging, and fill in applicable information.</p>

<p>The tagging form differs when tagging a single image (Single image tagging form) compared to when tagging multiple images (Batch image tagging form):</p>
<p>Single image tagging form:</p>

<h3 data-number="6.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-level-tags"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Individual-level tags</h3>
<p>The individual(s)-level tags refer to a tag applied to one or more individuals with the same combination of characteristics (i.e., all are adult males displaying the same behaviour). Note that what constitutes the “same combination” will depend upon the tagging field options selected within camera project settings. Individual(s)-level tags appear in the upper gray portion of the tagging page.</p>
<p>The following fields can be optionally selected in the camera project settings to classify characteristics of one or more individuals (if they have the same characteristics) in a tag.</p>
<p>Some of the tagging field options are “one-to-many fields,” meaning you can select multiple options that apply. In the tag report, one-to-many fields will occur as a comma-separated list.</p>
<p>Since more than one individual-level tag may occur for a single image, it’s important to note that each tag corresponds with a unique row in the tag report (see section 7.1 Data Downloads).</p>
<p>Species The species menu is divided into Mammals, Birds, and Human tags. Common and frequently used species appear at the top of the drop-down menu to facilitate quick tagging.</p>
<p>Special species tags are also used:</p>
<p>Unidentified: a species tag used if the individual in the image cannot be identified based on visible features. This is often used when the only images of an individual are blurs, blotches of fur, etc. NONE: a species tag used for motion-activated images with no individual(s) present. STAFF/SETUP: a species tag used for the series of photos taken while staff are setting up or taking down the camera (humans that occur within the first or last series, using a 5-minute series gap). This tag is applied automatically if the STAFF/SETUP auto-tagger is selected in the project settings. Count (camera) Count is the number of individuals of a particular species, age, sex, behaviour, etc. (i.e., applies to a specific tag where all other fields remain the same rather than an image). For example, if adults and juveniles occurred together in an image, the count would not equate to the number of both adults and juveniles, but rather, a separate tag for juveniles should be applied, and the counts in the separate tags should include the number of adults and the number of juveniles, respectively.</p>
<p>The default count for all wild animals is ‘1.’ The number can be changed if the count is greater than one. The default count for domestic animals, birds, vehicles, and humans is ‘VNA.’ Users can also input VNA if they do not want to collect information in this field.</p>
<p>Age class Age class is the categorical age class (choose one) of individual(s) in a tag (when identifiable).</p>
<p>Age class options:</p>
<p>Adult (Adult; default for mammals): an animal that is old enough to breed. Juv (Juvenile): an animal during its first summer [mammals older than neonates but still requiring parental care]. The juvenile tag is only used for an animal’s first summer when they have apparent juvenile features, such as spots. UNKN (Unknown): the age class of the individual is unclear. VNA (Variable not applicable; default for domestic animals, birds, and humans): the tag does not apply, or the user is not interested in collecting information for this field. Sex class Sex class is the categorical sex class (choose one) of individual(s) in a tag (when identifiable). For example, ungulate species such as deer, elk, and moose can be identified by sex class based on the presence of antlers, but antlers are not manifested year-round. Therefore, it is recommended that antler-less ungulates are only tagged as a female between May 15 and October 1. Outside of these dates, if antlers are not present, the default of UNKN should be used. Some species, such as bears, are often photographed with their young. When an adult mammal is with a juvenile, it can be assumed to be Female and tagged as such.</p>
<p>Sex class options include: Male, Female, Unknown (default), and VNA (variable not applicable). Users can select VNA if they are not interested in collecting this information.</p>
<p>Behaviour Behaviour is a one-to-many field (choose all that apply) used to classify behaviour(s) of mammals (reported as a comma-separated list when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Behaviour options include: Travelling, Standing, Running, Feeding/Foraging, Drinking, Bedding, Inspecting, Inspecting Camera, Vigilant, Territorial Display, Rutting/Matting, Unknown, Other, and VNA (variable not applicable; default).</p>
<p>Health/Disease Health/disease is a one-to-many field (choose all that apply) used to classify descriptors of health and/or disease status (reported as a comma-separated list when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Health/Disease options include: Poor Condition, Discolouration, Hair loss, Lumps, Scarring, Injured, Malformed (environmental and/or genetic), Diseased, Ticks, Mange, Dead, and Other.</p>
<p>Direction of travel Direction of travel is a categorical field (choose one) used to classify the direction of travel of moving individual(s). The 12 categories represent the 12 positions of a clock. Assuming the camera always faces 12 o’clock position, the option entered for a moving individual should represent the clock position that an animal moves towards in relation to the direction the camera faces. For example, if the animal travels from left to right, and the movement is perpendicular to where the camera faces, the direction of travel would be “3 -o- Clock.”</p>
<p>Direction of travel options include: 1 -o- Clock, 2 -o- Clock, 3 -o- Clock, 4 -o- Clock, 5 -o- Clock, 6 -o- Clock, 7 -o- Clock, 8 -o- Clock, 9 -o- Clock, 10 -o- Clock, 11 -o- Clock, and 12 -o- Clock.</p>
<p>Coat colour Coat colour is a one-to-many field (choose all that apply) used to classify the coat colour(s) of mammals (reported as a comma-separated list when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Coat colour options include: Beige, Cream, Brown, Chocolate Brown, Dark Brown, Black, Blonde, Cinnamon, Grey, Red, Orange, Yellow, White, Melanistic, and Other.</p>
<p>Coat attributes Coat attributes is a one-to-many field (choose all that apply) used to classify attributes of mammals’ coats (reported as a comma-separated list when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Coat attributes tag options include: Spots, Speckled, Salt-pepper, Stripes, Cross-Phase, Chest Blaze, and Other.</p>
<p>Antler tine attributes Antler tine attributes is a combined field (choose one combination) used to document information on antler tine attributes, including antler position (the side of the rack being categorized), tine count (the number of antler tines present) and tine count precision (the precision of the tine count). Users will only be able to apply this tag to mammal species with antlers (e.g., Moose, White-tailed deer, etc.).</p>
<p>Antler tine attributes:</p>
<p>Antler position: the side of the rack being categorized (options include: Left, Right, and Symmetrical) Tine count: the number of antler tines present. Tine count precision: the precision of the tine count (options include: Exact, Approximate, and At least) A screenshot of a computer</p>
<p>Description automatically generated</p>
<p>Note that the three antler tine attributes are concatenated into one value in the resulting tag report.</p>
<p>Collar Collar flags are used to identify individuals affixed with a collar (e.g., a GPS collar; may be interpreted as “off-leash” for Domestic Dogs) (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Ear tag Ear tag flags are used to identify individuals with ear tags (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Interacting with human feature (IHF) Interacting with human feature (IHF) flags are used to indicate when individual mammals use or interact with human features (e.g., an animal walking in the adjacent forest vs.&nbsp;along the fence, or digging in a compost pile) (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Tag needs review Tag needs review flags are applied when species attributes are unclear and need to be checked. Each individual-level tag in an image is associated with a review tag, so it is clear which tag needs to be reviewed (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Tag comments Tag comments are any comments entered by the observer to describe any additional details about the individual(s)-level tag. Note there is also a field to document image comments.</p>
<p>Field of View (FOV) is the extent of a scene that is visible in an image (Wearn &amp; Glover-Kapfer, 2017).</p>
<p>For remote cameras, the camera’s FOV is influenced by how the camera is set up (i.e., camera height and angle, slope, etc.), and it often remains largely unchanged throughout a deployment. However, a camera’s FOV can change during deployment, such as snow blocking the lens or because the camera was nudged by an animal moving past it (e.g., and now faces another tree rather than an open area). When the camera’s FOV has changed when compared to the setup view, users should use the image FOV tags to document images that shouldn’t be included as part of the observation period (and thus the sampling effort). It is important to use the image FOV tags correctly since they allow for the correct estimation of each camera’s sampling effort.</p>
<p>FOV Field of View tags are only used when the camera’s FOV has changed significantly (for 3+ hours) compared to the FOV at setup. When this occurs, the images are considered to be ‘Out of range,’ and the observation period ends for the camera. The image(s) may be motion or time-lapse-triggered images.</p>
<p>FOV ‘Out of Range’ criteria:</p>
<p>The camera’s FOV changed for 3+ hours The change in FOV was “significant”, which may occur due to: Loss of visibility – e.g., the lens is more than 50% covered (by snow, vegetation, fallen trees, etc.). Discretion is used where (e.g.) cattle are leaning on a post and making the camera go in and out of position repeatedly. In such cases, the camera is said to be not working properly the whole time this is happening. Major changes in the roll, pitch, and yaw of the camera: Roll – the tilt is more than 30 degrees from level. Note: The lines in the image below show the angle to which the horizon would need to rotate to be considered out of range. Pitch – the camera’s angle shifted upwards or downwards such that the pole (if used) is now beyond the bottom of the image or above the center of the image. Yaw – the bottom of the pole (if used) is out of view beyond the right or left side of the image. Application of Image FOV tags There are four potential FOV tags, “Within,” “Out of Range,” “END – Last good image in FOV,” and “START – First good image in FOV”. Importantly, the Out of Range tag is automatically applied to the images between the END and START tags (if applied) after a FOV review has been completed.</p>
<p>If the FOV remains unchanged (or altered, but for &lt; 3 hours) compared to the setup view, the camera’s FOV is assumed to be “Within” the normal range (the default), and the observation period includes the entire deployment. However, what if, for example, you’re tagging an image set with ~2,500 images, and there was a period in the middle of the deployment (e.g., images 1001-1551) where snow covered the lens of the camera for more than 3 hours, and thus, these images should be considered “Out of Range.” However, users do not need to manually apply the Out of Range tag manually since WildTrax will populate it automatically after the field of view review if the END and/or START tags are applied. For the first 999 images, the user can leave the image FOV as the default (“WITHIN”) since the FOV remained the same as the setup view, and thus the observation period began with the first image and continued until the FOV changed. Users should apply the END tag to image 1000 since it is the last image with the correct FOV and signifies the end of the observational period. Since the snow melted after image 1551, the user should apply the START tag to image 1552 to signify that the observation period has recommenced.</p>
<p>To summarize, follow these instructions to use the FOV tags correctly:</p>
<p>WITHIN (default): applied to images where the camera is assumed to have the camera setup FOV (i.e., is “WITHIN” the normal range). The Field of View field defaults to ‘WITHIN’ as images are assumed to be within range. Out of Range: applied to images where the camera’s FOV has changed significantly (for 3+ hours) compared to the setup FOV. This tag does not need to be applied manually; WildTrax will complete the process automatically during the Field of View review. Images may be motion or time-lapse images. END – Last good image in FOV: if the FOV has changed significantly (for &gt; 3 hours), apply to the last image with the correct FOV (the camera setup FOV) before the FOV changed (e.g., the last image before snow covers the lens or a cow leans against the camera) to signify the end of the observational period. Note that the ‘END’ and ‘START’ tags are only used if the view changes compared to the set-up images. START – First good image in FOV: applied if a) the END tag was applied, and b) if the camera’s FOV returns to the correct FOV (the camera setup FOV); applied to the first image captured with the corrected FOV (e.g., snow melts or the cows stops leaning against the camera) to signify that the observation period has recommenced. Don’t apply a ‘START’ tag at the beginning of an image set to indicate that the camera has been successfully set up. Note that the ‘END’ and ‘START’ tags are only used if the view changes compared to the set-up images. After the Field of View review is complete (see the section on Field of View review), the ‘Out of Range’ tag will be automatically applied to the images between the END tag (end of the observation period) and the START tag (beginning of a new observation period). Snow presence Snow presence flags are applied to images where snow is present on the ground (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags). If snow is in the air (i.e., it is snowing) but not on the ground, snow presence should not be flagged.</p>
<p>Image snow depth (m) Image snow depth (m) is the depth of snow (in metres) at the distance at which the camera detects motion at the ground/snow surface level.</p>
<p>Image water depth (m) Image water depth (m) isthe depth of water (in metres) at the distance at which the camera detects motion at the water’s surface.</p>
<p>Fire presence Fire presence flags are applied to images where the camera was clearly triggered by fire. Note: there may be animals present in these images or not (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Malfunction Malfunction flags are applied to images when it appears that the camera is not working properly (e.g., images are completely black or pixelated) (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Nice Nice flags are used to highlight high-quality images, so they are easier to find at a later date (reported as ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ when syncing tags).</p>
<p>Image comments Image comments are comments entered by the observer to describe any additional details about the image. Note: there is also a field to document individual(s)-level comments.</p>

<p>There are four main tagging scenarios you may encounter:</p>
<p>≥ 1 images / 1 individual / 1 species: if you select one or more images with a single individual of a species, then a single tag is applied. Once the tag fields are completed, click “Save All and Close” to apply the tag. 1 image / &gt;1 individuals / 1 species: if you select a single image that contains &gt; 1 individual of a single species, but age and/or sex differ among these individuals, then multiple tags are applied. Once you have completed the tag fields for the first individual, click to create a new tag for the next individual. Example: an image with a female moose with a calf. In this case, you would create a unique tag for each individual. 3) 1 image / ≥ 2 species: If you select a single image that contains &gt; 1 species, then multiple tags are applied. Once you have completed the tag fields for the first species/individual, click “Add Tag” to create a new tag for the next species/individual. Example: an image where a deer triggered the camera and a coyote was also captured in the background. In this case, you would tag the deer and then click “Add Tag” to create a second tag for the coyote (or vice versa).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>1 image / &gt;1 individuals / 1 species / tags differ: If you select multiple images that contain &gt; 1 individual of a single species and age, sex, or any other tags (e.g., behaviour) differ among these individuals, then multiple tags are applied. Once you have completed the tag fields for the first individual, click “Add Tag” to create a new tag for the next individual.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>Update all untagged Images with abundant species that will all have the same tag, such as Domestic Cows, may be left untagged until the end. Once all other images in the image set (including NONE) have been tagged, you can select the Updated All Untagged button and enter the Domestic Cow tag in the tagging window. Doing so will tag all remaining untagged images (on all pages) as Domestic Cow. The Updated All Untagged button can be used for any species whose tag attributes (e.g., Individual count, Sex class, or Age class) defaults to ‘VNA.’ Thus, the button can be used for all domestic animals, humans, or NONE. This button cannot be used if the tag attributes vary.</p>

<p>Species verification is completed as part of a quality control step within WildTrax to ensure the accurate application of tags. This step is only carried out when all image sets within a project have a status of ”Tagging Complete”. In general, all wild mammals are double-checked. Domestic and bird species are verified at the discretion of the project administrator, who assigns species to taggers.</p>
<p>The main objectives for species verification are:</p>
<p>Ensure manually-applied species tags are correct Ensure context-tagged species tags are correct Ensure auto-tagged species tags are correct (if applicable) Conduct additional analyses on verified images To complete species verification:</p>
<p>Access your assigned species through the Verify Species tab of the project page.</p>
<p>Checks to complete during species verification: Correct species ID tag(s) and use of attributes tags. If errors are found, you can edit the tag by open the tagging form either by: clicking on the image and selecting the “Tag Selected” button in the top right-hand corner of the screen or clicking on the tag below the image. In both cases, edit the tag in the tagging form and click “Save All and Close.” Once all images on a page have been checked, click on the “Verify Species” button (e.g., Verify Canada Lynx) at the bottom of the screen. The next page of images to verify will automatically appear. When all images on a page are verified, the images and page navigation boxes turn green to indicate they are complete.</p>
<p>Notes on species verification</p>
<p>If a tag was given a “Tag Needs Review” tag during the first round of tagging, that image will have an orange border around it in the side panel to emphasize that this image’s species tag needs to be reviewed with extra care. ‘Unidentified’ and ‘Tag Needs Review’ tags: Images labelled as ‘Unidentified’ and ‘Tag Needs Review’ are either unidentifiable species and shapes that triggered the camera or identifications that taggers are not 100% sure of, respectively. These tags should be double-checked to verify that tags have been applied correctly. Tags with the ‘Tag Needs Review’ flag that cannot be identified but still possess identifying features should remain as ‘Tag Needs Review.’ However, if the species in the tag cannot be identified and there are no identifiable features, re-tag the species as ‘Unidentified’ and remove the ‘Tag Needs Review’ tag.</p>

<p>Double-checking the location information is an easy but important task. It should be completed for all applicable tasks where reference signs was used during field set-up and/or pick-up activities. If this does not apply, please continue to the section on Tagging images.</p>
<p>If applicable, you can review the initial STAFF/SETUP photos and compare the location name on the reference sign against the photo labels on WildTrax. If the STAFF/SETUP portion of the auto-tagger and ‘Hide Auto-’ were selected in the camera project settings, STAFF/SETUP photos will be automatically hidden from view in the image tagging page. If these settings apply, the filter will need to be adjusted to complete location validaton.</p>

<p><strong>Point counts</strong> are a methodology used to survey animals, mainly birds. It involves an observer standing at a pre-determined location for specific period of time, counting the individuals they detect. Specifically for birds, this detection can either be aurally or visually. To account for error in detecting a species, either because it didn’t sing or wasn’t observed during the survey, or the observer misses or misidentifies it, distance estimation and duration intervals are used. All these attributes are what define a survey in WildTrax. When the observer detects a species, it is assigned into a <strong>distance band</strong>, the <strong>duration interval</strong> it was detected, a species and the abundance (or count of individuals). Each detection then becomes an <strong>observation</strong>.</p>

<p>To upload and sync your survey data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Manage button and select Upload Surveys.</li>
<li>In the pop-up window, select Choose a CSV file to upload your survey data.</li>
<li>Once uploaded, the QA Project Data button will turn green. Click it to verify that your data adheres to WildTrax standards. Note: This process may take a few minutes depending on the file size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Survey data automatically creates new locations if they don’t already exist in the organization and links existing locations to spatial metadata if names match. Locations can be merged as needed, and visits for single-visit surveys can be generated directly within the organization, ensuring seamless integration of survey data into WildTrax while maintaining metadata consistency.</p>

<p>The point count survey page outlines the observations and many other attributes of the survey. The header contains information on the duration method, distance method, location name and date and time of the survey. It also contains the weather panel indicating the local weather conditions. You can also use the <img src="assets/pencil.png" height="20"> or <img src="assets/dropdown-arrow.png" height="20"> at any time to access any project level functions. Species are then listed on the left side of the page with their appropriate distance and time intervals bins they were detected in. You also have the location map available on the map from where the survey took place.</p>

<p>To publish a point count project first ensure that all surveys have been added to the project and that all associated metadata is prepared as intended (e.g.&nbsp;check location spatial coordinates to ensure everything is there).
